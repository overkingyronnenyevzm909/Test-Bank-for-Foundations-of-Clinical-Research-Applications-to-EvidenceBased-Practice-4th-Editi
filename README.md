  * Become a successful evidence-based practitioner
 
  * How do you evaluate the evidence? Is the information accurate, relevant and meaningful for clinical decision making? Did the design fit the research questions and was the analysis and interpretation of data appropriate?
 
  * Here are all the materials you need to take your first steps as evidence-based practitioners…how to use the design, data and analysis of research as the foundation for effective clinical decision making. You’ll find support every step of the way as you progress from the foundations of clinical research and concepts of measurement through the processes of designing studies and analyzing data to writing their own research proposal.
  * * Updated examples to provide students with a relevant context for understanding designs and analyses
    * * Conceptual description of analytic procedures used in evidence-based practice as well as tables to demonstrate simple calculations
      * * Algorithm for choosing a statistical procedure based on a study's design
        * * Diagrams that aim to assist in a student's understanding of experimental and observational design variations
          * * Guidelines for critical appraisal of various types of studies
            * * Strong emphasis on evidence-based practice, including a focus on sensitivity/specificity and likelihood ratios, number needed to treat, measuring clinically meaningful change
